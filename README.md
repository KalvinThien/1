# vidgen (video generator) ❤️‍🩹

This is a tool to algorithmically generate those videos you see all over TikTok, where some AI voice is reading out popular reddit posts while the background is some dopamine-rush mobile game footage.

### Example video generated by vidgen

### Installation

I recommend the use of a python virtual environment.
Create using `python3 -m venv .venv` while in the project root directory to create it in `.venv`, then, before use, do `source .venv/bin/activate`.
Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

#### Directory structure

The program kind of expects the following directory structure under `data/`.

This means you're gonna want to provide a font.ttf and gonna need to provide background footage (for your convenience, by default, a libre font is provided.)

`audio/` is used for the text-to-speech output files generated using [oscie57/tiktok-voice](https://github.com/oscie57/tiktok-voice) (Thanks!)

`db/` is populated with an sqlite3 database to store reddit posts

`subtitles/` is used for .srt files to store subtitles generated using [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (Thanks!)

`ttf/` contains the font to be used

`video` contains
+ `bg/` which contains individual folders whichthen contain your background footage
+ `done/` which is populated with the generated videos

`config` contains
+ `dicts.py`, which are some dictionaries used to sanitize the reddit posts and, importantly, the list of subreddits used (currently: `r/tifu`, `r/amitheasshole`, `r/relationship_advice` and `r/confession`) and the method to query them (currently: `rss` or `web` -- as in RSS or web-scraping)
+ `structure.py`, which defines some directories and the font path, name and size.


`tree` output:

#### main.py

`main.py` provides a convenient way to use the program. By default:
1. it downloads the daily top posts from the subreddits provided in `config/dicts.py`, 
2. saves them into the DB, then, 
3. for each one, it generates a text-to-speech audio file, 
4. a subtitles `.srt` file, 
5. composes the audio with a random background video from `video/bg/random_folder/random_file`,
6. burns subtitles onto the composed file
7. cuts up that video into 50-second chunks (so they can be uploaded as YouTube shorts, for example.) 
8. (Planned) automatically uploads the parts to configured platforms

It takes the following options from the command line:

+ `--no-web`: Do not save new posts from the web
+ `--no-audio`: Do not generate audios
+ `--no-subtitles`: Do not generate subtitles
+ `--no-video`: Do not compose videos
+ `--no-youtube-upload`: Do not upload to YouTube (currently irrelevant)
+ `--quick`: Work on a limited number of posts only
+ `--quick-limit`: Set the limit used in `--quick`, default: 1

### Planned features

+ Automatically uploading generated videos to platforms such as YouTube (shorts), TikTok or Instagram (reels)
+ A web interface to manage the generation (and uploading)
